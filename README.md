## Simulation study

The file simulation.ipynb contains the code necessary for replicating the results in Section 5.1.

## Study of STAR dataset

The file STAR-CATE.ipynb contains the code necessary for replicating the results in Section 5.2. In particular, this uses data taken from [Tennessee's Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR) project](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=hdl:1902.1/10766).
